  <title>Introduction to Chemistry and The Scientific Method</title>

  <introduction>
    <p> In our first module, we will begin to develop our understanding of chemistry and take a closer look at how scientists approach understanding the world around us. Specifically, our goals are to: Develop an understanding of chemistry.Define the steps of the scientific method. Recognize the difference between a scientific theory and scientific law. Distinguish between qualitative and quantitative observations. Classify independent, dependent, and controlled variables.
